# Clothing Detection

This repository contains Python code for detecting and extracting clothing items from images using DeepLabV3 and OpenCV. It identifies clothing shapes, key edge points, and bounding boxes.

## Features

*   Utilizes DeepLabV3 for accurate background segmentation.
*   Employs OpenCV for contour analysis and shape detection.
*   Extracts key edge points of clothing items.
*   Calculates the bounding box of detected clothing.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   OpenCV
*   PyTorch
*   Torchvision
*   Pillow (PIL)
